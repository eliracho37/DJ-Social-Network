The Charted DJ Network of Resident Advisor: Detecting Collaborative Connections & Measuring Popularity in EDM DJ Communities 

Abstract: \n 
Collected & visualised the temporal & social development of the intra-chartings of DJs on RA. Using social network analysis, graph theory, & modularity algorithms, we found 7 discrete communities of DJs (N=7,888) formed on the basis of 54,360 edges or chartings over 9 years. Further research, revealed these networks to be strongly rooted in shared geography, musical style, collaborative connections, & label affiliation. The most influential DJs – measured using eigenvector-centrality – tended to also be music producers. Popularity in each community was measured as an aggregation of ‘likes’ on RA. The most collaborative & reciprocal group of DJs – partitioned on mutual edges then k-core percolated to its minimum – shares more likes on RA than the 7 algorithmically detected ones do.

All research was completed in Spring 2016 at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, England, UK as course work towards M.Sc. in Computational Social Science. The data itself originates from ResidentAdvisor.net. The technology used to access/scrape the site was Import.io software. The visualization and analysis were performed using Gephi. The full dataset contains 11.333 DJs as nodes and 93.515 chartings as edges.
