# DJ-Social-Network

Abstract: 
Collected & visualised the temporal & social development of the intra-chartings of DJs on RA. Using social network analysis, graph theory, & modularity algorithms, we found 7 discrete communities of DJs (N=7,888) formed on the basis of 54,360 edges or chartings over 9 years. Further research, revealed these networks to be strongly rooted in shared geography, musical style, collaborative connections, & label affiliation. The most influential DJs – measured using eigenvector-centrality – tended to also be music producers. Popularity in each community was measured as an aggregation of ‘likes’ on RA. The most collaborative & reciprocal group of DJs – partitioned on mutual edges then k-core percolated to its minimum – shares more likes on RA than the 7 algorithmically detected ones do.
